# Objects
"I invented the term object-oriented, and I can tell you that C++ wasn't what I had in mind"
  Alan Key

## OOP Terminology
* Class
* Object
* Instance
* Instantiation
* Class variable
* Instance variable
* Method
* Method overloading
* Operator overloading
* Inheritance

1. EverythingIsAnObject
2. type(obj)
3. isinstance


### Practice
* assignment == aliasing
* class -- as namespace with entities
* def method(self, *args) (self just a convention)
* x.f() is exactly equivalent to MyClass.f(x)
* static vs non-static
* data attr overrides method name
* _name is "treated" as protected
* name mangling __blha --> _classname__blha (to prevent name clash during inheritance)
* __str__ -- toString

* Example: iterator (case study)
	* docstring
	* self
	* __init__ -- ctor
	*  vars: self.<name>
	* __iter__
	* __next__ --> StopIteration # itertools
